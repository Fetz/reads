# Tech Radar

Inspired by [Thoughtworks Tech Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/).
In this file I will record things that I'm using or that I want to use, or that I want to keep an Eye.
This list by no means is complete, but is something that I will thrive for.

Maybe when I have time I should create an automatically a google spreadsheet, so I can add to https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/how-to-byor

Ratings:
- Adopt - Things that I'm using regularly
- Trial - Things that I'm trying and experimenting
- Assess - Things that I'm keeping an Eye and want to use it in a near future
- Hold - Things that I'm not using anymore (normally I will remove it from the list only if is a good case to preserve it)
